# bash-profile
Personal repository for bash profile and aliases

On any new machine, create this folder (bash-profile from this repository) in the home directory, and then create a ~/.profile file and copy something like this in that: 

    export BASH_PROFILE_PATH=~/bash-profile
    source $BASH_PROFILE_PATH/.profile
