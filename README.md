# bash-profile
Personal repository for bash profile and aliases

On any new machine, clone this repository to your home directory (such that the folder **bash-profile** is created in the home directory). Then create a ~/.bash_profile file (if not already there) and copy something like this in that: 

    export BASH_PROFILE_PATH=~/bash-profile
    source $BASH_PROFILE_PATH/.profile
